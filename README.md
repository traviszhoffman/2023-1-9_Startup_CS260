 Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTPS)., caddy acts as gateway,  The name server (NS) record contains the names of the authoritative name servers that authorize you to place DNS records in this DNS server, The start of authority (SOA) record provides contact information about the owner of this domain name.Route 53 is the AWS service that handles everything DNS related., subdomains, whois, 

 Every DNS server in the world references a few special DNS servers that are considered the authoritative name servers for associating a domain name with an IP address.

The DNS database records that facilitate the mapping of domain names to IP addresses come in several flavors. The main ones we are concerned with are the address (A) and the canonical name (CNAME) records. An A record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A CNAME record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map byu.com to the same IP address as byu.edu so that either one could be used.
